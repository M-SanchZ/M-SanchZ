# üí´ About Me:
<br><br><br>I‚Äôm an aspiring IT professional interested in systems administration, network management, and troubleshooting. Although I‚Äôm relatively new to the field and don't yet have formal industry experience, I am actively working on gaining hands-on knowledge through personal projects and self-study. <br><br>Currently, I‚Äôm focused on learning and working with a range of technologies, including **ticketing systems** (specifically **osTicket**), **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**, **Active Directory**, **DNS management**, and **network file shares and permissions**. I‚Äôm passionate about mastering these tools because I believe they form the backbone of IT support and network infrastructure. By building out my skills in these areas, I‚Äôm preparing myself to solve real-world technical challenges and support businesses with their IT needs.<br><br>Though I'm still in the early stages of my IT journey, I'm committed to gaining practical experience, and I‚Äôm always eager to expand my knowledge. I'm actively working through real-life projects that give me hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how networks and systems operate. My goal is to transition into a full-time IT role, where I can contribute to a team, continue learning, and grow within the industry.<br><br><br><br>
